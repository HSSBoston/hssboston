### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a teenage girl who code. I did programming for the first time with Lego WeDo and [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/hssboston/) when I was a K student. You can see some of my early Lego WeDo models and Scratch games [here](https://github.com/HSSBoston/early).ðŸ˜„

My first textual programming language was [Squeak Smalltalk](https://squeak.org/). I used it in a few summer science projects when I was an elementary school student. Most of my recent projects use Python and Raspberry Pi. I was a member of the [Earth, Wind & Flare](https://github.com/HSSBoston/earth-wind-and-flare) team, which was selected as a Global Finalist at [2022 NASA Space Apps Hackathon](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/), and the [Jimmy-in-the-Box](https://github.com/HSSBoston/jimmy-in-the-box) team, which won a [Global Championship](https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/awards/) at the [2021 NASA Space Apps Hackathon](https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/). 

Besides coding, I play the piano, ukulele and tennis. I also like reading, camping, biking and cooking. I love pandas!!! :panda_face:

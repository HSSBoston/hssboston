### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My first programming language was Lego WeDo. I was a K or 1st grade student who LOVED lego. (I still like it a lot.) Then, I came across [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/hssboston/) and Code.org. I used Squeak Smalltalk as my first textual language when I was a 3rd grader. Since then, I have been using Pharo Smalltalk and Python. Most of my recent projects use Raspberry Pi and Python. I am a member of the [Jimmy-in-the-Box](https://github.com/HSSBoston/jimmy-in-the-box) team, which was nominated to the global judging at the [2021 NASA SpaceApps Hackathon](https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/). 

Besides coding, I play the piano, ukulele and tennis. I like cooking, reading and camping. I am very good at making fresh pasta noodles.

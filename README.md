### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a teenage girl who loves coding, music, stargazing, and playing tennis. I did programming for the first time with Lego WeDo and [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/hssboston/) when I was a kindergarten student. You can see some of my early Lego WeDo models and Scratch games [here](https://github.com/HSSBoston/early).ðŸ˜„ I still love Lego; my dream is to buy all the lego sets in the world and build an empire!

My first textual programming language was [Squeak Smalltalk](https://squeak.org/). I used it in a few summer science projects when I was an elementary school student. Most of my recent projects use Python and Raspberry Pi for Internet of Things (IoT) device development. I also use Java and JavaScript in several projects. You can find all my projects [here](https://github.com/HSSBoston?tab=repositories) at GitHub and a few of them at [my Devpost portfolio page](https://devpost.com/HSSBoston). I have completed Harvard Universityâ€™s [CS50P](https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python), Girls Who Code's summer program on data science an AI, and Python Instituteâ€™s associate certification ([PCAP](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcap)).

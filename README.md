### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a tween girl who code. I did programming for the first time with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/hssboston/) when I was a K student. I also enjoyed Lego WeDo, which is another graphical (block-based) programming language, as I loved Lego. You can see some of my early Scratch games and Lego WeDo crafts [here](https://github.com/HSSBoston/early).ðŸ˜„


My first textual programming language was [Squeak Smalltalk](https://squeak.org/). I used it in a few summer science projects when I was an elementary schooler. Most of my recent projects use Raspberry Pi and Python. I am a member of the [Jimmy-in-the-Box](https://github.com/HSSBoston/jimmy-in-the-box) team, which has been selected as a [Global Finalist](https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/awards/global-finalists) at the [2021 NASA SpaceApps Hackathon](https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/). 

Besides coding, I play the piano, ukulele and tennis. I also like reading, camping, biking and cooking. I love pandas!!! :panda_face:

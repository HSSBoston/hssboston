### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My first programming language was Lego WeDo. I was a K or 1st grade student at that time. Then, I came across Scratch and Code.org. I used Squeak Smalltalk as my first textual language when I was a 3rd grader. Since then, I have been using Pharo Smalltalk and Python. Most of my recent projects use Raspberry Pi and Python. I am a member of the Jimmy-in-the-Box team, which was nominated to the global judging at the 2021 NASA SpaceApps Hackathon.

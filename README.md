### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a teenage girl who loves coding, music, stargazing, and playing tennis. I did programming for the first time with Lego WeDo and [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/hssboston/) when I was a kindergarten student. You can see some of my early Lego WeDo models and Scratch games [here](https://github.com/HSSBoston/early).ðŸ˜„ I still love Lego; my dream is to buy all the lego sets in the world and build an empire!

My first textual programming language was [Squeak Smalltalk](https://squeak.org/). I used it in a few summer science projects when I was an elementary school student. Most of my recent projects use Python and Raspberry Pi for Internet of Things (IoT) device development as well as Web frontend development with JavaScript. You can find all my projects [here](https://github.com/HSSBoston?tab=repositories) at GitHub and a few of them at [my Devpost portfolio page](https://devpost.com/HSSBoston). I have completed Harvard Universityâ€™s [CS50P](https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python) and earned Python Instituteâ€™s associate certification ([PCAP](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcap)).
